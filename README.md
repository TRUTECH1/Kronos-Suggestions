Kronos-Suggestions
==================

Just some suggestions for Kronos the Minecraft Hacked Client

1.) like huzini, make it so tracers change color as players get closer

2.) There is a small bug where the chest esp will turn grey. :(

3.) make it so that it automaticly detects what team your on and makes it so you dont attack that team

4.) there is a minor bug where xray will not see ores that are near other ores (mining while using xray has ores just popup in front of you

5.) add a theme option (I like the current one but maybe other people may not)

NOTES FOR KRONOS

please keep the KillAura's locking features (It's easier to troll people 'cause they think it's legit)
